FILE PURPOSE

This footer file only differs from the footer file located in the root directory in that it has 3 closing div tags above the copyright div.

This footer file is currently still required for this reason, although I should aim to eliminate it in the future. Right now it is still needed in order to keep the footer positioned outside of the main content divs that contains the articles.
