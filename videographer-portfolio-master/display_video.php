FILE PURPOSE

This file is included in the video.php file.
If the user clicks on the "ALL" tab while on video.php, then this file will be displayed on the page.
This particular tab will display all of the videos that have been entered in to the database, regardless of their category.

The 'display_hide' field in the datbase is a boolean. If the display_hide row is set to '1' instead of zero for a specific video row, then that video will not be displayed when the user is viewing this tab or the tab for the category that the video belongs to.

The $descriptionvalue variable AKA the 'description' row for each video corresponds to a summary that has been submitted to give a brief descripton of the video. 
When the user clicks on the 'View Additional Project Information' url they are taken to the 'video_details.php' page, which will display a full list of details on the video project, such as more detailed description of the video.
The more  detailed description of each video is being stored in the 'vid_details' table, while all of the brief overview information of the video is being stored in the 'video' table that's being used in this file.

The nl2br() function is used on the video description (the summary) in order to make the data  display with line breaks.
