## Overview

A website for a wedding photographer. The website features a home page, an about page, a gallery to showcase the photographer’s portfolio, and a contact page so clients can enquire about bookings. The driving force of the website is to increase bookings. The way this is achieved is by directing potential clients to that contact page, being personable and honest about their approach to wedding photography, and displaying images throughout the website. 

## User Stories

* I want a website that is easily accessed on my mobile phone or tablet. 
* I want to be able to easily navigate the website. 
* I want to be able to view the photographer’s portfolio to see if their style suits my needs. 
* I want to be able to easily find the relevant information. 
* I want to be able to contact the photographer for any questions I may have. 
* I want to know more about the photographer. 
* I would like to see the photographer’s social media accounts to see more of their work. 

## Project Goals 

* I want to showcase my photography portfolio. 
* I want to increase bookings for photographic services. 
* I want to increase brand awareness. 
* I want to grow my social media following. 
* I want to be contactable by potential clients. 
* I want an easy to navigate a website for customers. 

## UX 

This website aims to target couples who are planning their wedding. The priority focus is to drive potential clients to the contact page, as well as the social media accounts. Before deciding on a photographer for a wedding, it’s important to view their portfolio. For this reason, I opted to use a simple, and minimalist design with lots of photos. 

I also aimed to be very personable in the text as it's not only the photos that attracted potential clients, but also the person behind the camera. 

## Strategy 

The goal of the website is to showcase the photographer's portfolio, to increase brand awareness by driving potential clients to social media accounts, and to grow bookings and inquiries via the contact page. 

### Business Goals: 

* Increase brand awareness.
* Showcase examples of previous photographic events.
* Drive users to the contact page to increase the number of bookings. 
* Mobile-first design to target large audiences who don’t have a PC/Laptop. 
* Simple and effective UX to keep the focus on the portfolio.

### Customer Goals: 

* Mobile-friendly website.   
* Searching for a high-quality wedding photographer. 
* A simple, and easy to navigate website. 
* Possible to view photographer’s portfolio.
* Contact the photographer easily. 
* Being able to connect via social media. 
* Someone who understands the importance of capturing special moments. 

## Scope 

The Scope and features of this project were based on market research of similar photographers in the wedding industry. A simple and clean UX allows the focus to remain on the two most important aspects of the website; the portfolio and the contact page. 

## Structure 

I am opting for a clean, and minimalist UI and UX. While the navbar links to the relevant pages, I also linked the portfolio and contact pages via a button beneath the About Me snippets on the Home page. I feel this helps to keep a streamlined approach to the website, and reduces users scrolling up/down every time they want to navigate between important pages. 

I kept the text sections of the website short with enough relevant information about the photographer and their approach to not overwhelm clients with unnecessary text and information. 

## Skeleton 

All wireframes were developed with Balsamiq. As there are slight design changes for the mobile/tablet/desktop versions of the site, I have created wireframes for each screen type. I have linked the relevant pages below. 

- Note: To open links in a new tab, please use CTRL+click (on Windows and Linux) or CMD+click (on macOS).

## Surface 

### Colours

I chose to employ a minimalist and clean design for the website. 

For my navbar, and footer I decided to use an off-white/yellow (#DEDCD7) background color which works well with the images used throughout the website. Many images were black and white and I felt the background color complimented these photos. The navbar color also complimented the home page hero image as the color is present within the image. 

For my background color, I opted to use a much lighter shade the navigation bar, mixed with a white (#ffff) this resulted in a dark white (#EAE9E8) which helped the text and photos pop, while not feeling out of place or diminishing the UX. 

For text color, and buttons and borders I chose to use color #212529 which is a dark grayish-blue. I decided to use this instead of all-out black color for text, headings, and borders as I believe it was easier on the eyes, and also complimented the off-white (#f7f7f7) background color. 

### Font

I decided to use the Merriweather font for my navigation bar, as I felt it was very easy on the eyes, and worked well with the overall theme of the website. 

For the headings and body of text, I chose to Fira Sans font as it paired well with Merriweather. I also liked that Fira Sans was a weighty font, and popped with the off-white background. 

## Features 

#### Current Features 

I chose to just show two reviews on mobile instead of three which is what is featured on the desktop. This was a design choice as three reviews on the mobile site felt cluttered. 

Initially, I wanted to use a carousel to display photos, however upon researching carousel interaction stats, it seems that most research indicates that less than 1% of users click on this feature. Given the importance of quickly capturing a user's attention especially in the portfolio section, it seemed like a poor UX and UI design choice. Instead, I opted for a grid layout that quickly shows the photographer's photos. 

#### Future Features

I would like to add a feature which would allow the purchasing of photos to buy adding a shopping section for clients. Clients could input their allocated password, and choose which photos from their wedding they would like to purchase. 

## Technologies Used 

This website was developed using [HTML5](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML5) and [CSS3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSS). 

[Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) was used to structure the website, and to assist in keeping the website responsive across a variety of devices. 

Bootstrap was linked into the HTML document via [CDN](https://www.bootstrapcdn.com/). 

[Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/) was used for numerous icons used throughout the website. These include the hamburger icon in the mobile navigation bar, social media footer links, and quotation marks in the testimonial section of the website. 

[Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) was used to import typography. 

[Git](https://git-scm.com/) version control tool to store the version of files and track progress.

[Gitpod](https://www.gitpod.io/) was the IDE used to work on this project. 

[Github](https://github.com/) to manage my Git repositories. 

[W3C](https://validator.w3.org/) to check validity of HTML code. 

[W3C CSS](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) to check validity of CSS code. 

[Google Mobile-Friendly Test](https://search.google.com/test/mobile-friendly)

## Testing

* I clicked on each navigation link on every page to ensure that they were directed to the correct page.
* I also clicked on the navigation brand on every page to ensure that it directed users back to the home page. 
* I tested each social media link in the footer to make sure that they linked to the correct social media website, and also opened up a new tab when clicked. 
* I tested each button on every page to ensure that they directed users to the relevant sections. 
* I opened DevTools and checked the responsiveness of each page on desktop screens to small mobiles to ensure that the website was responsive across all devices. 
* I tested the image gallery on all screen sizes to ensure all photos showed in the correct order, and with intended spacing. 
* I tested each section of the contact form to make sure that the form could not be submitted without the required fields having the necessary information. 
* I also tested the contact form to ensure that once filled in correctly, there were not any errors preventing it from being submitted. 
* I re-tested all pages on mobiles to ensure that there weren't any errors with button functionality and button spacing. 
* I input every piece of code both for the CSS style sheet, and the HTML pages through the W3C validator to ensure that no errors were present. 
* I also tested the website via Google's Mobile-Friendly Test service to ensure that it was responsive on mobiles. 
* I noticed an issue with the parallax feature on iOS devices and I tried to remedy this bug in various ways by changing the background-image size and how it was contained within the div. As the issue was only present with the deployed version of the website (on GitHub Pages). As a result, I had to make a couple of unnecessary git commits to troubleshoot the issue as I was unable to use Dev Tools or another live preview. 

### Testing User Stories 

* "I want a website which is easily accessed on my mobile phone or tablet." 

     * The website is mobile responsive across all devices, and I have taken steps to ensure a smooth mobile experience. This includes removing features that otherwise take away from a clean and simple mobile UX. The navigation bar is designed to be drop-down on both mobile and tablet screens to allow for maximum screen space. 

     * You can see this [here](./assets/images/user-story-mobile-view.png) 

* "I want to be able to easily navigate the website." 

     * Once a user enters the website, they are presented with a clean, and easy to understand navigation bar. The website has been designed to be user-friendly, and easy to navigate across all devices. At the top of each page, there is a simple navigation bar with clearly defined navigation links.
    
     * If users scroll down on the home page, they are shown images, and two buttons which users can click on to direct them to more information about the photographer, or to view the photographer’s portfolio. 

     * There is also a call to action button beneath the photographer's portfolio which encourages users to contact the photographer. This button directly leads users to the contact page. 

     * At the bottom of every page, the footer is populated with navigation links to social media accounts, and the other pages of the website. This ensures that users can easily navigate to other pages without unnecessary scrolling. 

     * Also, both the navigation bar, and the footer feature visual cues to inform users which page they are currently viewing. 

     * You can see this [here](./assets/images/user-story-navbar.png) 

* "I want to be able to view the photographer’s portfolio to see if their style suits my needs." 

     * When users enter the website they are presented with a large image by the photographer. There are photos used throughout the website on all pages. This allows users to view different photos on all pages, and not just on the portfolio section of the website.

     * The portfolio page can be accessed from the navigation menu, the footer navigation links, as well as a button on the home page.

     * You can see this [here](./assets/images/user-story-portfolio.png) 

* "I want to be able to easily find the relevant information."

     * All pages are clearly labeled for users to find. Headings are frequently used to establish the content of the relevant page. I have also opted to use bottom borders to aid in the separation of content on some pages where there is a lot of information.

     * You can see this [here](./assets/images/user-story-navigate.png) 

     * Also, there are visual cues that tell the user which page they are currently viewing. I have also added a hover effect for the navigation bar and the footer, so users can easily identify which page they are clicking on. 

* "I want to be able to contact the photographer for any questions I may have."

     * In keeping with the philosophy of having a website that has a clean and simple UX/UI, I have added a page that contains a contact form. This allows users to contact the photographer. Beneath the photographer’s portfolio, I have also added a button that directs users to the contact page.

     * You can see this [here](./assets/images/user-story-contact.png) 

* "I want to know more about the photographer." 

     * When users first enter the website, they are presented with a slogan and some text which highlights the photographer’s philosophy; to capture meaningful photos. 

     * On the home page, there is also an ‘about’ snippet with a button that redirects users to the ‘About’ page. 

     * Users can find more information about the photographer, and their photographic style on the 'About' page. 

     * You can see this [here](./assets/images/user-story-about.png) 

* "I would like to see the photographer’s social media accounts to see more of their work." 

     * I have added social media links in the footer which allows users to follow the photographer's social media accounts. Also, I prefaced these links with a friendly statement to encourage people to click on the links.

## Troubleshooting

* For the quote section, I wanted an icon in the middle of a horizontal line. I had a lot of trouble implementing this, and I found a solution on Stack overflow [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/39129052/add-font-awesome-icon-in-middle-of-horizontal-line )

* I ran into an issue where there is some extra margin showing on the right-hand side of mobile devices. I found a fix in setting a media query with my navbar padding max-width for mobile. Solution found on Stack overflow [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/17815390/large-right-margin-when-browser-is-shrunk-to-mobile-size-on-bootstrap)

* When adding images for the images on the home page - specifically for the section with two photos in black and white, there was another problem with overflow on the right-hand side. I solved the issue by adding 0px padding in the container. 

* I ran into an issue where I was unable to hide an image on mobile only. Looking through the bootstrap documentation, I found a solution with display classes "d-none d-sm-block". 

* I had an issue when adding a hover effect to the navbar items. I only wanted to target the nav menu items and not the navbar brand. However, when I hovered over the brand an underline border would appear. I resolved the issue by further targeting the nav menu items with .mynav ul a {}

* I also had an issue when using the hover effect for nav-items where there would be a slight jump in the page. This was due to an issue with the underline border. I found a fix via [Youtube](https://youtu.be/LV3w60037EI?t=1074). The solution was to add a transparent border targeting the same class which would eliminate the little jump when hovering over nav items. 

* I also experienced an issue with the large photo on the contact.html page. On desktop the image was centered, however on mobile the image took up too much space. This was resolved by adding a media query for smaller devices and setting the height vh lower than on desktops. 

* I wanted to collapse the navbar on mobile by clicking outside of the nav menu, instead of clicking the hamburger menu. I found a solution on [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/36405991/bootstrap-toggle-menu-on-one-page-site-does-not-uncollapse-when-clicked/36406437#36406437) which allowed me to collapse the navbar without clicking the hamburger icon every time. 

* I experienced an issue with adding wireframe images to the README.md file. I was unable to get the links to open in a new tab when clicked. Upon research, I learned you have to CTRL + click (Windows or Linux) or CMD + click (Mac) I found the answer on [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/41915571/open-link-in-new-tab-with-github-markdown-using-target-blank)

* There is an issue with the parallax scrolling feature on iOS devices. As a result, the background-images did not function as expected. It resulted in a very zoomed-in image that did not look good. Upon researching and discussing the issue with others, it seems that it is an issue with iOS devices, and my solution was to create a media query that disabled the parallax feature on smaller devices. The code was found on 
[StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/23838718/fixed-background-cover-becomes-zoomed-in-mobile-view/23839133#23839133).
